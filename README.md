# Codsoft Internship Projects

Welcome to my internship projects repository at Codsoft! This repository contains implementations and documentation for several data science and machine learning projects I worked on during my internship.

## Projects

### 1. Credit Card Fraud Detection
- **Description:** Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions to minimize financial losses.
- **Dataset:** Credit card transaction data.
- **Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
- **Conclusion:** •	Used data from Kaggle and Python for Data cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization and Over Sampling methods like RANDOM OVER SAMPLER to balance the data
•	Implemented different algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random -Forest to detect the fraud and it contributed to get the Accuracy Score of 99%


### 2. Customer Churn Prediction
- **Description:** Predicting customer churn to improve retention strategies and customer satisfaction.
- **Dataset:** Customer data with churn labels.
- **Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
- **Conclusion:** •	Used data from Kaggle and Python for Data cleaning, Data Analysis, Data Visualization and Over Sampling methods like RANDOM OVER SAMPLER to balance the data
  Implemented different algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random -Forest, Graduent Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbou to predict churn customers and it contributed to get the Accuracy Score of 87%


### 3. Spam Mail Detection
- **Description:** Identifying and filtering out spam emails to enhance inbox management.
- **Dataset:** Email data labeled as spam or not spam.
- **Tools:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
- **Conclusion:** Used data set from Kaggle and Python for pre-processing and done Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
•	Implemented models like Gaussian Naïve Bayes and Bernoulli Naïve Bayes to predict the spam mails and it contributed to get F1 Score of 99%
